### Hi there 👋 Welcome to my profile

- I'm a 🇩🇪 German 🇩🇪 student 👨‍🎓 and I'm interested in software development (I mean why else would I have a GitHub account? 🙃)
- I'm currently just doing some random stuff with Python and sometimes Java in order to gain experience 👨‍💻
- I'm especially good at spending too much time not noticing a small problem that causes my code to fail 😑😔
- I'm bad at thinking of good projects to work on 😪
- I don't know what else to write now 😶
